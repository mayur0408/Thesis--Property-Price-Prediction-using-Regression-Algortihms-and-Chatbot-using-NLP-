# Thesis : Property Price Prediction using Regression Algortihms and Chatbot using NLP
My final year project “Property Price Prediction Using Regression Algorithms, Chatbot using NLP” is a free to use dynamic website which helps people find approximate prices of their desired property in Mumbai, Thane and nearby localities based on various features user wants like number of rooms, location, area, car parking availability, lift availability and 12 other features by using regression ML model. Apart from that we also developed a fairly intelligent chat bot which could give response to certain specific commands related to website and also has knowledge about politics, sports, joke, humors and various other field. All this features are provided to user with a minimalist dynamic front end which scales automatically depending on laptop or mobile screen aspect ratio and developed using HTML and CSS.
